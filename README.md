# Summary

PHONE_HUNT is a web application that allows users to search for mobile phone models and view their details. The application fetches phone data from the Programming Hero API based on the user's search query. Users can initially view a curated list of phone models, and by clicking on the "Show Details" button, they can access additional information about each phone, including its specifications, brand, and release date. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and leverages asynchronous fetch requests to dynamically update the user interface with the retrieved phone data.
